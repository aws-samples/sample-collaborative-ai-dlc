# AI-DLC v2 Parallel Construction — Plan

Design and feasibility record for parallelizing per-unit construction work
("bolts") in the v2 execution engine. The parallelization grain is the
**unit of work** from the methodology's own `unit-of-work-dependency` DAG; the
engine schedules deterministic **lanes** over that DAG — no LLM dispatcher
(v1's loss mode #2), and no agent-owned git (v1's loss mode #1). The
methodology is imported from the pinned upstream repo and is **never
modified**; everything below is an interpretation of block metadata the seed
already imports.

Related docs: authoring model in [`v2-building-blocks.md`](./v2-building-blocks.md),
execution slice in [`v2-agent.md`](./v2-agent.md), park/resume design in
[`v2-resume.md`](./v2-resume.md), storage split in [`v2-data-model.md`](./v2-data-model.md).

Status: **planned** (feasibility verified, not yet implemented).

## Part A — Methodology mapping

### A1. Where fan-out is defined upstream

Pinned ref: `awslabs/aidlc-workflows@ba0cfe999856033ecb909a9135b46fe10811bf55`
(`terraform/variables.tf` → `aidlc_repo_ref`). These files are seeded into our
system as the **internal runtime snapshot** at S3 `aidlc-runtime/<ref>/<repo-path>`
(classification in `lambda/shared/block-mappers.js` `isRuntimeFile`, writes in
`lambda/seed-blocks/index.js`) — present but unused by the execution layer today.

Our engine already ports one piece: `parseBoltDag` / `computeBatches` in
`lambda/shared/v2-sensor-contract.js` ("faithful JS port of the upstream lib")
validates the ` ```yaml units: ` block of the `unit-of-work-dependency`
artifact at the sensor gate — but nothing schedules from it yet. Stage
`for_each` is mapped to `forEach` (`lambda/shared/block-mappers.js`) and
likewise ignored by the plan resolver and orchestrator.

The upstream model maps 1:1 onto our runtime primitives:

### A2. Structural rules

Derived **purely from block metadata** — no hard-coded stage names — so the
imported default workflow and any user-composed (forked) workflow get identical
semantics:

1. **Parallel section** := a maximal contiguous run (w.r.t. the topologically
   ordered in-scope plan) of stages with `forEach: unit-of-work`. N sections
   per workflow are supported generically; each section is one
   fan-out → lanes → merge cycle. The default workflow has exactly one.
2. **Fan-out point** := immediately before the section's first stage.
   Plan-time validation: an in-scope upstream stage must produce
   `unit-of-work-dependency`; otherwise the plan fails with
   `no_unit_dag_producer` (same style as `dangling_consume` in
   `lambda/shared/v2-execution-plan.js`; mirrors upstream's Doctor rule).
   At runtime, fan-out requires the human gate on that artifact to be approved.
3. **Lane** := one unit's sequential execution of the section's stages, in plan
   order, in its own AgentCore session (`aidlc-intent-<id>-s<k>-<slug>`),
   own workspace, own git branch. Stage instance ids gain the unit dimension:
   `si-sha256(namespace:stageId:unit-<slug>)` — deterministic, replay-stable.
4. **Lane blocking** := unit U's lane starts only when every `depends_on` lane
   of U has **MERGED** (lane-level blocking). Scheduling truth is the
   `unit-of-work-dependency` snapshot **only**; `bolt-plan` is never parsed for
   scheduling — it stays the human iteration document upstream defines.
5. **Fan-in point** := immediately before the first non-`forEach` stage after
   the section; requires all lanes of the section MERGED. In the default
   workflow this lands exactly on `build-and-test`, matching its own contract.
6. **Multiple sections**: each section fans out from the current intent-branch
   HEAD (which contains the previous section's merged work) and must fully
   merge back before any downstream non-`forEach` stage. Unit branches are
   per-section: `ai-dlc/<intent>--s<k>-unit-<slug>` — a unit gets a fresh
   branch per section, avoiding long-lived divergence.
7. **Per-unit stage skipping**: per-unit stages with `execution: CONDITIONAL`
   are skippable per unit. Mechanism: the fan-out gate presents a
   **unit × conditional-stage matrix** (defaults: all EXECUTE; hints pre-filled
   from the `unit-of-work` artifact's unit metadata, e.g. `unit_type`). The
   approved matrix is frozen into the UNITPLAN snapshot; skipped instances get
   stage state `SKIPPED`. `execution: ALWAYS` stages (e.g. `code-generation`)
   are not skippable. Decisions are deterministic and auditable — no runtime
   LLM judgement.
8. **Walking skeleton first** (stage-protocol.md): the first lane runs **solo**
   with a mandatory Bolt-level approval gate covering its design artifacts and
   generated code together, regardless of autonomy mode. Skeleton selection:
   the `bolt-plan` walking-skeleton marker / team-practices stance, confirmed
   by the human at the fan-out gate (deterministic once approved; a
   `PRACTICES_OVERRIDE`-style event is recorded when practices win over the
   bolt-plan marker).
9. **Autonomy ladder** (stage-protocol.md): immediately after the skeleton gate
   approves, exactly one prompt — **"Continue autonomously"** (remaining lanes
   run without approval gates; failures still halt-and-ask) vs **"Gate every
   Bolt"** (one approval gate per parallel **batch**, not per lane). Recorded
   on execution META as `constructionAutonomyMode: autonomous | gated`,
   audited (`AUTONOMY_MODE_SET`-equivalent event). This **replaces** per-stage
   human gating inside lanes; deterministic sensors and the LLM reviewer still
   run per stage. Failure semantics per upstream: preserve successful lanes'
   pushed work, present retry (same lane/branch) / skip / abort.

### A3. Git mapping onto the phases

All git is **engine-owned and deterministic**; the agent never commits, pushes,
merges, or holds credentials (v1 lost code precisely where agents owned commits
and an LLM orchestrator owned merges).

```
init-ws                     → create intent branch ai-dlc/<intent>
ideation/inception stages   → run on intent branch; ENGINE commits after every
                              stage exit (success, park, fail) + pushes
units-generation gate ✔     → engine re-parses unit-of-work-dependency,
                              snapshots UNITPLAN (DDB = scheduling truth; the
                              orchestrator has no Neptune access), mirrors
                              UnitOfWork vertices + DEPENDS_ON edges to Neptune
                              (traceability/UI only), captures skip matrix +
                              walking-skeleton pick
walking-skeleton lane       → runs SOLO on its unit branch → Bolt-level gate
                              → autonomy ladder prompt
── fan-out (per section) ───
lane start (unit U)         → engine: branch ai-dlc/<intent>--s<k>-unit-<slug>
                              from intent HEAD; own AgentCore session
per-unit stages             → agent works in its workspace; ENGINE commits
                              (aidlc(<stage>): <unit> — <executionId>) and
                              pushes after every stage exit; remote URL is
                              token-scrubbed after clone, re-injected only
                              inside engine push/fetch
lane end                    → engine merges unit branch → intent branch
                              (--no-ff), serialized via merge lock, completion
                              order (topo-safe: deps merged before dependents);
                              conflict → scoped conflict-resolution stage
                              (sensors must pass) → human gate on repeat failure
── fan-in ──────────────────
build-and-test etc.         → run once on the merged intent branch
                              (session aidlc-intent-<id>)
execution SUCCEEDED         → PR(s) per project prStrategy:
                              intent-pr (default) | pr-per-unit | stacked
```

Merging into the _intent branch_ (not base) preserves the methodology's shape:
one intent = one integrated increment, reviewed as a whole; dependent units
genuinely build on their dependencies' merged code because their lanes branch
off _after_ the merge.

## Part B — Feasibility findings (verified)

1. **Durable functions support lanes natively.** Verified against the deployed
   SDK (`@aws/durable-execution-sdk-js@2.0.0`, dist-types):
   `ctx.parallel` / `ctx.map` with `maxConcurrency` (omit for unbounded),
   named branches (stable checkpoint identity per unit slug), each branch a
   **full `DurableContext`** (steps, waits, `createCallback` inside lanes),
   independent per-branch checkpointing, `BatchResult` failure isolation
   (`toleratedFailureCount`), multiple concurrently-pending callbacks
   (parallel human gates; `CALLBACK_PENDING`). Wavefront options: batch
   barriers (`for (batch of computeBatches(dag)) await ctx.map(batch, lane)`)
   or true wavefront (lanes await their dependency lanes' DurablePromises);
   PoC proves the latter, the former is the fallback.
2. **CRITICAL prerequisite — async stage invocation.** Today `run-stage` is a
   _synchronous_ durable step (`lambda/v2-orchestrator/index.js` `runStage`),
   but the orchestrator Lambda timeout is 900s
   (`terraform/modules/api/lambda/main.tf`: "one step (a stage) must fit the
   function timeout") **and** AgentCore's synchronous request timeout is a
   hard 15 minutes. Interrupted steps re-execute on re-drive
   (`RETRY_INTERRUPTED_STEP`). Any stage > ~15 min is already at risk
   _sequentially_; N parallel lanes in a hot handler make timeout certain.
   Fix: short `run-stage-start` invoke → container runs the CLI as a
   **background job** (AgentCore async jobs: 8 h max; the `HealthyBusy` ping
   tracker already exists in `lambda/agentcore/http-server.js`) → container
   completes a **durable callback** via `SendDurableExecutionCallbackSuccess`
   (pattern exists in `lambda/intents/index.js` for human gates; container
   task role needs the IAM action). The orchestrator suspends at zero compute.
   This also fixes the latent sequential risk, independent of parallelization.
3. **AgentCore quotas — no blocker** for realistic fan-out: 2,500–5,000 active
   session workloads/account (adjustable), 400 new sessions/min per endpoint,
   `InvokeAgentRuntime` 200 TPS, 2 vCPU/8 GB per microVM, dedicated
   microVM + filesystem per session (the intended isolation model). Watch:
   **1 GB session storage per lane** (clone-size check at fan-out) and cost
   (per-lane release-on-park, extending the existing D1 logic).
4. **UI — feasible on existing primitives.** Multi-gate rendering already works
   (Map-keyed gates, one `GateCard` per pending gate); the hand-rolled DAG
   renderer (`IntentGraph` + exported, tested `layerStages`) is reusable for
   the lane board. Must build: `unitId` dimension across DTOs/WS events
   (none exists), a `UnitState` union + styling
   (`PENDING/READY/RUNNING/MERGING/MERGED/FAILED/BLOCKED`), per-unit
   stage-row merging (today's merge is 1:1 by `stageId` and would collide on
   fan-out instances), refetch debouncing (every `agent.stage` event triggers
   a full DTO refetch — N lanes multiply this), settings fields (pattern:
   `parkReleaseSeconds` in `ProjectSettings.tsx`). No graph library in the
   codebase; staying hand-rolled matches two prior deliberate decisions.
5. **Local PoC without AWS**: `@aws/durable-execution-sdk-js-testing@1.1.1`
   (in-process local runner with real replay/suspend semantics — the existing
   orchestrator tests use a fake ctx that does _not_ exercise replay).
6. **Residual unknown**: durable execution operation-count / payload quotas
   under N lanes × stages checkpoints — verify via the quotas console / cloud
   runner early in WP0/WP1.

## Part C — Work packages

Each step leaves the system shippable; sequential flow benefits from WP1+WP2
before any concurrency lands.

- **WP0 — PoCs (local)**: this document; then four PoCs on the local test
  runner: (a) wavefront with cross-branch dependency awaits vs batch barriers,
  (b) multi-callback park + out-of-order resume, (c) interrupted-step
  demonstration (documents why sync run-stage must go), (d) async-stage
  lifecycle (start step → background → callback → merge step) across replays.
- **WP1 — Async stage invocation**: callback-based `run-stage` (finding B2);
  container-side background job + callback completion + IAM; per-stage
  `callbackId` persisted on the STAGE row.
- **WP2 — Deterministic git layer**: `lambda/agentcore/git-engine.js` —
  engine-owned branch/commit/push on every stage exit, credential scrubbing,
  port of v1 `pushBranchWithRetry` semantics (retry + backoff + remote-HEAD
  verification); prompts/annex lose all git responsibility. Closes the
  documented v2 working-tree loss mode for the sequential flow immediately.
- **WP3 — Unit DAG promotion**: on fan-out gate approval, engine re-parses the
  artifact (`parseBoltDag`), writes UNITPLAN + `UNIT#<slug>` rows to the DDB
  process table (scheduling truth), mirrors to Neptune (`UnitOfWork`,
  `DEPENDS_ON` — already allowlisted); captures skip matrix (rule 7), skeleton
  pick (rule 8), autonomy mode (rule 9). Lane states:
  `PENDING → READY → RUNNING → MERGING → MERGED | FAILED | BLOCKED`.
- **WP4 — Plan fan-out**: section detection over `forEach` in
  `v2-execution-plan.js`, per-unit stage instances with unit-dimension ids,
  `no_unit_dag_producer` validation, N sections generically;
  `run-stage` accepts `unitSlug` + lane workspace; stage-materializer injects
  the unit's scope (its stories/sections from the DAG artifact).
- **WP5 — Parallel lane orchestration**: skeleton-solo → skeleton gate →
  autonomy ladder → wavefront over the UNITPLAN (deterministic replacement for
  v1's LLM construction orchestrator); `maxParallelUnits` project setting
  (0 = unbounded → omit `maxConcurrency`); batch-level approval gates in
  `gated` mode; halt-and-ask retry/skip/abort on lane failure (dependents →
  BLOCKED, independents finish, pushed work preserved); per-lane park/resume +
  release-on-park; lane transitions as durable steps + `EVENT#` rows +
  broadcasts.
- **WP6 — Fan-in**: serialized `--no-ff` merges in completion order, engine
  merge lock; conflict-resolution stage (fresh lane, conflicted merge state,
  sensors must pass, engine commits) with human-gate escalation;
  `prStrategy` project setting: `intent-pr` (default) | `pr-per-unit` |
  `stacked`, reusing `lambda/shared/git-providers*` + the v1 unmerged-branch
  guard.
- **WP7 — UI**: lane board (rows = units via `layerStages`, embedded stage
  strips, DAG edges; skeleton lane visually distinct), `unitId` across
  DTOs/WS (`agent.unit`, `v2.unit.*` events), gate lane-attribution, batch
  gates, refetch debouncing, settings (`maxParallelUnits`, `prStrategy`,
  autonomy default) in the v2 ProjectSettings card.
- **WP8 — Hardening**: integration fixtures — 3-unit DAG (A,B ∥ → C: A∥B run,
  C waits and sees merged A+B code), forced merge conflict (exercises the
  conflict stage), kill-a-lane mid-stage (pushed park-commits survive a mount
  wipe); `disjoint-files` advisory sensor on the unit DAG (warn on overlapping
  file ownership).
